#SaveFile.js 

This is the backbone of the File Loadout and File Load In components of the WebNotes Project. 

SaveMe! By WebNotes *A BeffsBrowser Project* is a easy way to save and load text files into a text area. Along side TinyMCE it is the perfect solution to your needs. You can also use it to load images if you change some of the js: 


` var textToSaveAsBlob = new Blob([textToSave], {type:"text/plain"});`

You can change the `Type` to save as a image. 

Other notes:

Things like this already exist I just decided to add a sub project giving you a step-by-step build of WebNotes!
